# rock-papper-scissors
Everybody has played rock paper scissors at least once, to make some sort of decison between friends. But for anyone who hasn't played rock paper scissors before the game goes like this: participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 
The rules are also not demanding: 
- Rock smashes scissors.
- Paper covers rock.
-Scissors cut paper. 

However, if you find yourself playing a variation of this game called "rock paper scissors lizard spock" from the Big Bang Theory the ruleset may be slightly different.

Usually, playing a game involves a certain level of strategy, but that when facing humans. Since in this case you are up against a computer the random function does the job.
